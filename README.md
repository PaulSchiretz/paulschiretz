# Hi, I'm Paul 👋

I’ve been building software professionally **since 2006**. I spend my workdays in a massive, "well-aged" **C++/Qt** and **Computer Vision** environment — a "living fossil" that has taught me exactly why architecture and maintainability matter over decades, not just weeks.

Outside of work, I’m a **"handyman" at heart**. Whether I’m repairing a bike or writing code, I value tools that are built to last. I prefer lean, purposeful logic and the **Unix philosophy** ("do one thing and do it well") over the heavy abstraction and framework bloat often seen in modern development.

### Projects & Experiments
* **Golang:** My favorite for its simple, no-nonsense approach to concurrency.
* **SQL:** I’m a "SQL nerd" at heart. There’s something deeply satisfying about a perfectly structured, high-performance query.
* **C++ / Qt:** My professional bread and butter, often used here for performance-heavy experiments.
* **Web Development:** Building custom plugins (**JS, PHP, CSS, HTML**) for my girlfriend’s e-commerce business.
* **Broad Toolset:** Experience with **C#, Java, and Pascal**, plus occasional **FreeBSD** tinkering to get closer to the metal.

### Teaching & Seeing the World
Before "Remote Support" was everything, I traveled a lot to provide on-site training for the software I develop. Seeing firsthand how people actually **use (and break)** systems in different environments is the best reality check an engineer can get. I also have a background in technical education (holding a **B.Ed.**), which probably explains why I still enjoy breaking down complex concepts until they actually make sense.

### Life off-screen 🚲
I live in Austria and enjoy a simple life together with my girlfriend (**she’s the best**, and actually the reason I started sharing my projects here instead of keeping them to myself) and plenty of interests outside the tech world. When I'm not at the desk, I'm usually:
* **Working with my hands:** Lately, that means repairing bikes or fixing things around the apartment.
* **Cleaning our apartment:** Keeping the place clean is a constant battle when those pesky spider webs and dusty corners seem to build themselves in record time 🤦‍♂️.
* **Plants & Outdoors:** I'm still trying to figure out how to raise **houseplants** properly. Besides this, I like taking walks and exploring different cultures.
* **Learning:** Spending a bit of time learning **Romanian**.
* **Drums:** Keeping the rhythm as a passionate drummer.
